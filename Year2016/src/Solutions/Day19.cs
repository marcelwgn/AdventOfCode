            // (in case of tie, pick the left person, i.e. the lower indexed person).
            // Then 2 continues killing the opposite person.
            // This process repeats until only one person is left, the index at the start is the number we want to calculate.
            // The idea behind the algorithm:
            // Calculating the problem for n can be transformed into the problem for calculating the n-1 solution.
            // Our approach is to move from n-1 to n.
            // If the current solution 'x' is larger than the half of n-1, the n solution is 'x+2', otherwise it is 'x+1'.
            // "Proof:"
            // * The n solution is the n-1 solution except we removed n/2 and we start at two meaning, our 2 is the 1 of the previous solution.
            //   That means we shift one forward from n to n-1 index wise.
            // * If the previous solution was about half, we skip the number we removed shifting the index by one more.
            // If the 'x+1' or 'x+2' is actually higher than 'n', we went around the entire circle and we start back at one.
            // Our algorithm starts with n=5 and x=2 and then moves forward using the rules above until
            // we reach n and modified 'x' correctly which will then be the solution for the problem of 'n'.
